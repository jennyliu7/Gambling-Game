# Project 2: Gambling Game
Players compete in a gambling game by taking turns to roll a die.
In each round, players can roll as many times as they want. Whatever they roll is the number of points they recieve.
Points add up in each round, unless the player rolls a 1, in which case they lose all points for that round (doesn't affect points earned other rounds).
The first player to reach 50 points wins!
